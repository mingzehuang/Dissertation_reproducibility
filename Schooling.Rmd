## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r 1}
library(Ecdat)
data("Schooling")
head(Schooling, n = 6L)
```

```{r 2}
mar76 = rep(0, dim(Schooling["mar76"])[1])
mar76[Schooling["mar76"] == "yes"] = 1 
schooling = data.matrix(Schooling)
schooling[ , c(1,2,3,4,5,6,11,13,14,15,16,17,18,21,23,27)] = schooling[ , c(1,2,3,4,5,6,11,13,14,15,16,17,18,21,23,27)] - 1
schooling[ , 26] = mar76
head(schooling, n = 6L)
```

```{r 3}
library(latentcor)
types = get_types(schooling)
types
```

```{r 4}
library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(latentcor(schooling, types = types, method = "original"),
               latentcor(schooling, types = types, method = "approx"), times = 5L)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
